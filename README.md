# Description

Yet another calculator? so useless...
I noticed a lot of sizeoffixer, math calculator, ... but none of them was complete so I decided to make mine

# How to use plugin System ? 

Plugin system allows you to create your own part of code and to execute it from the calculator. Just use
the base I put in the release and place it IN THE SAME directory as the calculator !
